0	In  our  laboratory,  we  found  trace  amount  of  the  virus  on  the  skin  of  fruits  and  vegetables  after  12  hours  of  being  touched  by  another  customer  who  was  infected.  We  recommend  our  staff  to  avoid  salads.  Do  not  eat  the  fruits  within  48  hours  of  purchase,  or  pour  some  boiling  water  over  the  fruit  before  cutting.  Berries,  apples,  cucumbers  and  tomatoes  are  the  worst  because  some  people  eat  the  skin.  This  explains  why  the  virus  is  spreading  faster  in  the  west  than  asia.  Most  Asians  do  not  eat  salad  and  very  few  people  eat  the  skin  of  any  fruit.  We  have  to  assume  anything  that  comes  from  outside  our  home  within  48  hours  is  infected.  Shoes,  clothes,  our  hair,  all  food.  Hope  that  helps,  pls  take  extreme  care.  Kind  Regards.

New  coronavirus  may  not  show  symptoms  for  several  days  (14-27  days).  How  can  one  know  if  the  person  is  infected?  By  the  time  he  has  a  fever  and/  or  a  cough  and  goes  to  the  lung  hospital,  the  patient  may  have  50%  fibrosis,  and  then  it  is  too  late.  Taiwanese  experts  provide  simple  self-monitoring  that  we  can  do  every  morning:  Take  a  deep  breath  and  hold  your  breath  for  more  than  10  seconds.  If  you  can  do  this  successfully  without  coughing  and  without  difficulty,  without  anxiety  or  chest  tightness,  it  shows  you  do  not  have  fibrosis  and  generally  indicate  no  infection..

The  cure  for  the  C19  virus  or  the  way  to  eliminate  it  was  achieved.  Information  comes  from  Israel  there  this  virus  did  not  cause  any  death.  The  recipe  is  simple.  1.  Lemon,  2  Bicarbonate.  Mix  and  drink  as  hot  tea  every  afternoon,  the  action  of  the  lemon  with  hotter  baking  soda  immediately  kills  the  virus  completely  eliminates  it  from  the  body.  These  two  components  alkalize  the  immune  system,  since  when  night  falls  the  system  becomes  acidic  and  defenses  lower.  That  is  why  the  People  of  Israel  is  relaxed  about  this  virus.
